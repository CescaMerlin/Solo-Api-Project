# Solo-Api-Project
This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

Instructions:

API Solo Project

Objectives

    Create a CRUD API service using Express/GraphQL, Relational database
    Write tests for your API
    Seed your database with interesting data
    Be able to document your API endpoints for other developers to use, aka a beautiful README
    Create a basic/simple frontend

Summary

    You have a couple days to create an MVP (minimum viable product)
    You will be doing a quick presentation of your API on Tuesday and it must include a demo

    Suggestions for slides:
    API Endpoints
    Additional Technologies Used
    Challenges and Struggles Faced

Requirements
    (chose not to do express)

    OR a GraphQL Server that:

    serves up a basic HTML file that describes your API service
    Has multiple types to query
    Offers mutations to delete, add, or modify data

    A basic HTML file that gets served up. It should have the name of your API and link to your API's GitHub folder
    Migration files  --> not necessary with graphback/graphql migrations api
    A script that will set up and seed a database
    API Documentation in the form of a README.md file https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme

    The top of your readme should say “This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis”

    A demo, but make sure to talk about what the API is about and the endpoints. Make sure your setup works!
    Publish your code to Github and make it public :)

Advanced Requirements

    Tests
    Deployed on Heroku, Firebase, etc.
    Create a basic/simple frontend that utilizes these endpoints.

Useful Tips:

    Start a new project from scratch:

    Consult and follow along the getting started guides of Express, your ORM library of choice, etc.
    You don’t need to separate code into multiple files before your server can be started properly.
