# Solo-Api-Project
This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

This project was designed to be a way to interact with a database of birds of prey, specifically owls, falcons, and eagles. Using the Graphback API queries and mutations are generated automatically so it is necessary to open a Playground to view specific syntax.
